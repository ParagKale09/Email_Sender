Hello! <br/>
• This is an Automatic email-sending tool that sends emails by scanning the Excel sheet if today's date and action date in Excel match. <br/>
• Specifically, the action date here is the birth date of the alumni, So when we run our program and if today's date is the birth date of the alumni then greet mail 
  automatically send to alumni with just one click. <br/>
• This project was made with Python and Flask at the backend and HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for the backend. <br/> 
•  --------------------------------------------------<b> Point to remember</b>----------------------------------------------------
While using email in the code you can't use the normal password of your email. You have to generate an App password to use the password in the code, Otherwise, if you use your normal password in your code it won't work. This is because (According to me) Google did not allow any third app or program to have direct access to email even if that third party app or program has your Gmail id and Gmail pass due to security concerns. Generally, this issue starts on 30 May 2022. To create an APP password two step verification must be on to your Google account and follow this procedure to create an APP password.
